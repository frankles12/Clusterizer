Clusterizer was created by a team of students with the goal to create a social media platform for UCF Digital Media students to connect with one another, alumni, professors, and potential employers. The platform offers all basic necessities of a social media platform such as a feed, user accounts, and a followers system. The platform was developed primarily in PHP and JavaScript.
